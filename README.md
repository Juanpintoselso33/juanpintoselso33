## ⚡ Fun Fact

I enjoy playing the guitar and delving into discussions about politics and history. A steadfast supporter of Club Nacional de Football, I'm Uruguayan but prefer to call myself "Oriental." Olimareño by birth and Fernandino by adoption, my hobbies include grand strategy games, a deep love for my country, and an appreciation for the music of Pink Floyd.
